I took a leap of faith and purchased my Maui condo June 2002 this was the beginning of fulfilling her prophecy to once again return to Hawaii soil.\r\n\r\nI am a tropical expression artist who paints on canvas and etched metal.  My work is inspired by the beauty of the islands and has been displayed in several Maui art galleries over the years.  I am a writer and have my first book on Amazon.

It is nice to know that we can contribute to someone’s Hawaiian vacation experience in a positive way. We love to hear back from our happy guests.\r\n\r\nI used to live on the island of Oahu with my US Navy family when I was young.  We later moved to Southern California.  I knew one day I would return to Hawaii, the place I fell in love with long ago. I took a leap of faith and purchased my Maui condo June 2002 this was the beginning of fulfilling her prophecy to once again return to Hawaii soil.\r\n\r\nI am a tropical expression artist who paints on canvas and etched metal.  My work is inspired by the beauty of the islands and has been displayed in several Maui art galleries over the years.  I am a writer and have my first book on Amazon.  I recently took up hula dancing and love to immerse myself in the culture and grace of this island.\r\n\r\nI have over 25 years of business administration and customer service experience working for large corporations and high tech startups.\r\n\r\nIf you are in need of a caring Realtor here on Maui, please contact Kathy McCartney RS#77317 of La Costa Realty Hawai’i, LLC Brokerage Lic #18349 .",

As business travelers we have had the opportunity to visit some of the most amazing cities but none of these locations have come close to the feeling of peace and serenity that we have found in Wailea. Grand Champions Villas is hands down the greatest value in all of Wailea. The central location, beautifully maintained grounds, security and space within the villas cannot be beat. The villa is perfected by a truly beautiful interior with a fresh, relaxing vibe. It was our goal to bring the beauty we saw in the grounds of Wailea to the interior of the villa where we spend time with our family creating cherished memories. We would love to share this magical place with you. Hula On In to Beach House Chic Style. With warmest aloha, Paul",

A ORM nasce da combinação das principais paixões dos seus fundadores: a cidade do Porto e as suas características culturais; a arquitetura e decoração; a gastronomia e fotografia e, acima de tudo, o contacto com diversas culturas. \r\n\r\nO projeto baseia-se no apoio e orientação de proprietários de imóveis localizados no centro da cidade que pretendam direcionar as suas casas para o mercado do turismo.\r\nEnvolve ainda a conceção e decoração destes mesmos espaços, conferindo-lhes desta forma, uma identidade única que se traduz na reação extremamente positiva dos nossos hóspedes. \r\nO nosso projeto culmina na gestão total do imóvel, que inclui a organização e a preparação destes espaços para o arrendamento turístico. \r\nAssim, com a nossa dedicação e trabalho diários temos vindo a conseguir conquistar todos quantos nos visitam e que demonstram a maior intenção de repetir as suas experiências com a nossa equipa. \r\nAcrescentamos ainda que além da gestão somos responsáveis pelo contacto constante com os nossos hóspedes e que prezamos o acompanhamento personalizado - o que nos distingue e nos permite uma maior proximidade com as diversas culturas.\r\n\r\n ",

        "about": "Olá,\r\n\r\nEstou no Airbnb desde 2011 e sou um grande fã da Plataforma. Tudo que conquistei foi graças ao sucesso no Airbnb!\r\n\r\nMinha experiência começou quando recebi um flat da minha avó através de herança (em vida!!), investi pesado na reforma do apartamento para poder oferecer o maior conforto possível aos meus hóspedes. Comecei a administrar seu aluguel e o sucesso foi tão grande que mudou a minha vida!\r\n\r\nMeus amigos e familiares viram como o meu “negócio” estava dando certo e começaram a pedir para que eu também administrasse o aluguel dos apartamentos deles (nessa época ainda não existia a figura do co-host). \r\n\r\nTopei o desafio e o número de apartamentos foi se multiplicando! O resultado foi ótimo e percebi que me sentia muito realizado com as experiências que estava ganhando como empreendedor e ao conhecer pessoas de tantos lugares do mundo! De tal maneira que decidi largar meu emprego como gestor em marketing para me dedicar exclusivamente a vocês!\r\n\r\nFiz um curso de guia de turismo para ter mais conhecimento sobre a cidade e abri a All in Rio, uma Agência de Turismo que oferece tours culturais, naturais e de aventura, além do aluguel de apartamentos de temporada.\r\n\r\nMeu objetivo é oferecer uma estadia segura, confortável e poder fornecer todas as informações necessárias para você desfrutar ao máximo a sua experiência em nossa cidade maravilhosa! \r\n\r\nObrigado pela atenção!\r\n\r\nFabio\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nHi!\r\n\r\nI've been on Airbnb since 2011 and I’m a big fan of the Platform. All I got was thanks to my success on Airbnb!\r\n\r\nMy experience began when I received a flat from my grandmother through inheritance (in life!!). I invested heavily in the renovation of the apartment to be able to offer the greatest comfort possible to my guests. I started managing the rent and the success was so amazing that it changed my life!\r\n\r\nMy friends and family noticed how well my \"business\" was going and started to ask me to manage their apartment’s rent too (at the time, the figure of  the co-host didn’t exist).\r\n\r\nI accepted the challenge and the number of apartments was multiplying! The result was great and I realized that I felt very fulfilled with the experiences I was gaining as an entrepreneur and by meeting people from so many places in the world! So I decided to leave my job as a marketing manager to dedicate myself exclusively to you!\r\n\r\nI took a tour guide course to gain more knowledge about the city and opened the All in Rio, a Tourism Agency that offers cultural, natural and adventure tours, as well as apartments for seasonal rents.\r\n\r\nMy goal is to offer you a safe and comfortable stay and to be able to provide all the information necessary so you can enjoy your experience in our wonderful city to the fullest!\r\n\r\nThank you for your time!\r\n\r\nFabio\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nComments from my guests:\r\n\r\n“This apartment is in the most amazing location. Leblon is beautiful, safe, and packed with fabulous restaurants. The apartment is just by the ocean - couldn't really be better. Communicating with Fabio was super-easy. He was really responsive and helpful. We are missing it already!” - Ed Pilkington (UK)\r\n“Fabio goes far and beyond the average host, my trip was a day earlier than I booked and I would have been stuck with no place to stay but Fabio personally went out of his way to get the place ready for me, great guy and will always go to him first when traveling to Rio. Thank again Fabio abs!!” - Darren Sanford (USA)\r\n“O apartamento é lindo como nas fotos e a localização é perfeita! O Fábio é super atencioso e respondeu super rápido nossas dúvidas. Recomendo muito!” - Bruna Ferrary Deniz (Brasil)\r\n“The apartment was better than we could have imagined. The photos don't do it justice. The place is huge, in a great location. Fabio was a very accommodating host. I would definitely stay there again.” - Jordan Giordano (USA)\r\n“Our stay at Fabio’s place was fantastic! The apartment is simply beautiful and it made us feel at home. Super stylish and cozy. We are very particular about the properties we stay at, and this one exceeded our expectations The apartment description was very accurate! We loved being so close to the beach and all the great restaurants around. Thank you very much!”- Pablo Perez (Canadá)\r\n“Fabio was a perfect host.  He answered promptly all our questions and is a really nice guy!”- Daniela (Brasil)\r\n “Fabio is the perfect host. Friendly and extremely helpful”.- Soren (Denmark)\r\n “It is really difficult for me to put down in words how grateful I am to Fabio! He is a wonderful host and a GREAT person!”- Justine (Dubai)\r\n“Más que anfitriones, hicimos una linda amistad. Gracias por todo... “- Leo y Aura (Colombia)\r\n“Fabio is a very friendly and considerate person and clearly takes great care of the apartment”.- Jonathan (Spain)\r\n“New to Rio? You should definitely speak to these guys.”- Vitaly (Russia)\r\n “Fabio is an amazing host with a deep concern for his guests' comfort. We feel that we now have a good friend in Rio!”- Ali (Canada)\r\n",

Located near the beginning of the longest uninterrupted white sand beach in the whole state, you can run (or walk) from our unit all the way (six miles -in front of Kihei Canoe Club, Maui Canoe Club and a few condos to the protected area along the Kealia Pond National Wildlife Refuge and board walk) to Maalaea Harbor (with the excellent Maui Ocean Center, Maui Golf & Sports park for the kids, many restaurants, Pacific Whale Foundation - and a bus stop to deliver you back in front of Kihei Bay Surf. Our complex has a good swimming pool, hot jacuzzi, tennis courts, BBQ area, and clean laundry facilities. \r\n\r\nOur corner unit is bigger and has more light than most of the other units in our complex. The wrap-around lanai offers more space than the other units as well. It has a queen bed and a sofa couch for sleeping. The unit has been renovated and upgraded several times since my mom first lived there when she arrived on Maui from Chicago in 1985 to teach English at Maui College. She loved her job and Kihei -- and she met a nice, handsome counsellor working at the college. They got married - and had me. \r\n\r\nAnd I just got married in August to my beautiful bride, who has a 8-year-old son. We feel very blessed. And we hope to share our love of place with you. \r\n\r\nAt KBS, you will be close to Kihei Canoe Club, where both my mom and I have done competitive outrigger canoe paddling. You can experience being out on the water if you go to the KCC Visitor Paddle on Tuesday or Thursday morning. Get there by 7:15 am to make sure you get a spot. During the winter, you may see whales while you are on the water. Allow a couple of hours for the experience. My mom is a volunteer for the HIHWNMS - the free museum and whale sanctuary across the street. On Tuesdays and Thursdays, you can hear a free lecture from 11am until noon about the Humpback Whales. The museum is open from 10am-3pm, Monday-Friday, and on the last Saturday of the month from 10am-1pm. The mission is to educate the public and protect humpback whales and other marine life and our environment. \r\n\r\nAnother activity that is nearby is Hawaiian singing, ukulele, and hula on Thursday nights from 7-8:30 pm. at the Keolahou Church, 177 S. Kihei Rd. It is joyful - and a glimpse of Hawaiian culture. \r\n\r\nCome stay. We think you will have a wonderful time.",
